* The set number should appear at the beginning of each set, using underlining and/or bolding to make it easy to find.

The program is designed to account for some alterations of this formatting; but for better use of this program, keep the following rules in mind:
1. Make sure you are using a PDF, TXT, or DOCX file
   -> Note the 'x' at the end of DOCX... a DOC file currently won't work
   => Other file extensions will be available soon
2. Be sure the point value of each question is present and correctly identified.
   -> Example: '10 points'
3. Ensure the correct introductory remarks are present for each question.
   -> This may not be easy, but do your best
4. Make sure the question itself ends with the appropriate punctuation (either a question mark or a period)

Failure to comply with these rules may result in incorrect output or an error.
