## Version 2.0.1

### Features
- Changed header version to 2.0.2
- Added link to version notes
- Included questions that ask for the reference(s) for individuals/geographical locations to "A concordance" note
- "A concordance" now accounts for individuals/geographicals described "with the word ___"
- "A concordance" now accounts for identical Chapter Analysis
- Standard quote/essence questions are now split by where they come from (book, chapter, section)
- Added note for questions that ask for the verse from which a section gets its name

### Bug Fixes
* Did not account for extra/missing space between the point value and "points"
* Wasn't able to determine type of answer if "answer" was capitalized
* "___ did what" notes were overwriting "According to verse" notes
* "A chapter" wasn't identifying questions that asked for which individuals/geographical locations were "contained"
* "A section" was overwriting "A concerning ___"
* "of" phrases weren't being detected when asking how the author(s) "complete the #-word phrase"
